# Technical Overview

## Approach

1. **Scraping**:  
   Tweets are collected for specified hashtags using Selenium-based automation, with login step for access to Twitter/X.

2. **Text-to-Signal Conversion**:  
   - Tweets are transformed into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
   - Sentiment analysis is performed using TextBlob.
   - Optionally, custom features (e.g., keyword presence, tweet length) can be engineered.

3. **Memory-Efficient Visualization**:  
   - Large datasets are visualized via random sampling.
   - Histograms, bar plots, and other charts are generated for sampled subsets.

4. **Signal Aggregation**:  
   - Multiple text features (e.g., sentiment, keyword scores) are combined to form composite trading signals.
   - Confidence intervals are calculated using mean and standard deviation or quantiles.

5. **Performance Optimization**:  
   - Concurrent processing (thread pools, scikit-learnâ€™s `n_jobs`) is used for scraping and feature extraction.
   - Data is read/processed in chunks for scalability.
   - Parquet format is used for efficient storage and loading.
   - Dask-compatible code examples can be added for 10x scale.

## Key Files

- `src/scraping.py`: Scrapes tweets and saves to `data/tweets.parquet`.
- `src/analyze.py`: Loads tweets, extracts features, aggregates signals, and generates plots in `analysis/`.
- `analysis/plots/`: Contains generated plots.
- `analysis/signals.csv`: Feature matrix (document-term or TF-IDF matrix with metadata).
- `analysis/composite_signal_stats.txt`: Summary statistics for aggregated signals.

## Extensibility

- Add more hashtags by editing the list in `scraping.py`.
- Add new features (e.g., embeddings, sentiment) by modifying `analyze.py`.
- For very large datasets, replace pandas with Dask in analysis scripts.
